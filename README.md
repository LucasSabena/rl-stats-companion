## About

After Psyonix disabled BakkesMod for online play with the EAC update, players lost their primary stats tracking tool. The new official Rocket League Stats API streams live match data locally — but there's no official app to consume it.

**RL Stats** fills that gap. It reads the local TCP stream from your game, parses every event, and gives you:

- **Live Dashboard** — Real-time player stats, scores, boost levels, and event feed during matches
- **Match History** — Every match you play, saved locally with full detail: goals, assists, saves, demos, ball hits
- **Performance Analytics** — Win rates, averages, trends, and streaks over days, weeks, months, and play sessions
- **OBS Overlay Streaming** — Built-in HTTP/WebSocket server for OBS Studio browser sources with live scoreboards, player stats, and event feeds
- **Session Detection** — Automatic grouping of consecutive matches into play sessions based on configurable time gaps
- **Privacy First** — All data stays on your PC. No accounts, no cloud, no telemetry.

## OBS Overlay Streaming

The app includes a built-in HTTP/WebSocket server for streaming live match data to OBS Studio as browser source overlays.

### Available Overlays

| Overlay | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Scoreboard | `http://127.0.0.1:9528/overlays/scoreboard` | Live score, arena, timer, OT badge |
| Player Stats | `http://127.0.0.1:9528/overlays/player-stats` | Blue/orange team panels with stats |
| Event Feed | `http://127.0.0.1:9528/overlays/event-feed` | Goals, saves, demos in a live feed |
| All-in-One | `http://127.0.0.1:9528/overlays/all-in-one` | Combined scoreboard + stats + events |

### How to Use

1. Go to **Settings > Streaming OBS** and click **Iniciar streaming**
2. Open OBS Studio and add a new **Browser** source
3. Copy and paste one of the overlay URLs into the URL field
4. Adjust width/height to match the overlay design
5. Start Rocket League and play — the overlays update in real time

The server runs locally on `127.0.0.1`. The default port is `9528` (configurable in settings). Make sure your local firewall allows connections to this port.

### Custom Overlays

Developers can create custom OBS overlays using the included RL Overlay SDK:

```html
<script src="http://127.0.0.1:9528/sdk/rl-overlay.js"></script>
<script>
  const overlay = RLOverlay.connect({ port: 9528 });
  overlay.on("state", (data) => {
    console.log("Blue:", data.scoreBlue, "Orange:", data.scoreOrange);
  });
</script>
```

The SDK auto-detects the port from the page URL when loaded from the overlay server.

## Session Detection

The app automatically groups consecutive matches into play sessions. A session is a sequence of matches where the gap between matches does not exceed a configurable threshold.

### How It Works

- Matches are ordered by start time and grouped when consecutive matches are played within the **session gap** (default: 30 minutes)
- If more than 30 minutes pass between matches, a new session starts
- The session gap can be configured in **Settings > General**
- Sessions are used in the **Analytics** page under the "Sesion" tab for per-session performance stats

---

## Prerequisites

- **Windows 10 or 11** (the app is Windows-only for now)
- **Rocket League installed** on the same machine
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (stable)
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/) with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended)

---

## Installation

### Download

Prebuilt Windows installers are published on every tagged GitHub release.

- Go to **GitHub Releases**: `https://github.com/LucasSabena/rl-stats/releases`
- Download one of the Windows x64 artifacts:
  - `*.msi` - Recommended standard Windows installer
  - `*-setup.exe` - NSIS installer
  - `*.zip` - Portable bundle when available

### Packages And Release Assets

Each release is expected to ship these assets:

- `RL Stats_<version>_x64_en-US.msi`
- `RL Stats_<version>_x64-setup.exe`
- `latest.json` for the Tauri updater
- `checksums.txt` with SHA256 hashes

The project is open source, so source code, release notes, issues, and binary downloads all live in the same GitHub repository.

### Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LucasSabena/rl-stats.git
cd rl-stats

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode (Vite dev server + Tauri)
pnpm tauri dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

The output will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:
- `RL Stats_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe` — NSIS installer
- `RL Stats_x.x.x_x64_en-US.msi` — MSI installer

---

## Configuration

The Rocket League Stats API must be enabled before the app can capture data. The API streams events locally on `127.0.0.1:49123`.

### Enable the Stats API

1. Go to your Rocket League config directory:
   ```
   %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Rocket League\TAGame\Config\
   ```
2. Open or create `TASystemSettings.ini`
3. Add these lines under `[SystemSettings]`:
   ```ini
   [SystemSettings]
   AllowPerFrameYield=False
   AllowPerFrameSleep=False
   bEnableReplayStatsAPI=True
   ```
4. Save the file and restart Rocket League

> The app will show a connection status indicator on the Live Dashboard page. If the API isn't enabled or the game isn't running, you will see a "Waiting for match..." state.

## Architecture

The app follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
Rocket League ──TCP──► Ingestor ──► Parser ──► SessionManager ──► Storage (SQLite)
                                           │              │
                                           ▼              ▼
                                    Tauri Events    OverlayServer
                                           │       (OBS via HTTP/WS)
                                           ▼
                                    Frontend (React/TS)
```

- **Ingestor** manages the TCP connection to `127.0.0.1:49123` with reconnection and exponential backoff
- **Parser** validates JSON and maps raw events to strongly-typed Rust structs
- **SessionManager** tracks match lifecycle (Waiting -> Active -> Finished) and drives both the frontend and overlay server
- **OverlayServer** broadcasts live state to OBS browser sources via WebSocket and REST endpoints
- **Storage** uses SQLite in WAL mode with connection pooling for concurrent reads
- **Frontend** communicates with the backend through type-safe Tauri commands

For a detailed breakdown of modules, database schema, and API surface, see the [Architecture Document](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Limitations

The Rocket League Stats API does **not** provide:

- **MMR / Rank / Division** — The API streams in-match data only, not competitive rankings
- **Historical match data** — No access to Psyonix servers; the app only captures matches played while it's running
- **Reliable playlist/mode detection** — The API does not reliably report whether a match is Ranked, Casual, or an Extra Mode
- **Distance traveled or total boost used** — These are estimated as derived metrics (not directly provided by the API)
- **Cross-platform support** — Windows only in V1; macOS/Linux may be explored in the future
